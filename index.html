      <h2>Easy-To-Make Juice Concentrations</h2>
      <p>
        Each of our orders come in cases. One case contains 6 bottles. 
        Those bottles contain half a gallon of fruit juice concentration. 
        A 1 gallon pre-measured Mix Pitcher is provided free with your first order.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can make juice in 3 and a half gallons worth of water with just one bottle of juice concentration!
        Simply pour a cup's worth of concentration (0.23-0.27 liters) into the Mix Pitcher. 
        Then pour enough water so that it reaches a gallon's worth of both liquids. Stir thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
        No need to refrigerate!
